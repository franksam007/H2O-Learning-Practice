H2O currently supports the following file types:

* CSV (delimited) files
* ORC
* SVMLight
* ARFF
* XLS
* XLSX
* Avro version 1.8.0 (without multifile parsing or column type modification)

_Notes:_

* ORC is available only if H2O is running as a Hadoop job.
* Users can also import Hive files that are saved in ORC format.
